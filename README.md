# EmilySchwabe


Purpose: This project completes week 7 assignment. In this assignment I started to learn about git and the ability to share data. This assignment allowed me to practice comitting, pushing and pulling data. 

This project was completed on RStuido version 1.2.5001. 
R packages:
library(dplyr)  
library(ggplot2)

Data Files in Order of Use:
1)data/Gaeta_etal_CLC_data_1.csv: this is a large data file that I consists of fish data.
2)scripts/fish-analysis.R: this code mutates and makes a histogram the data from data/Gaeta_etal_CLC_data_1.csv. 
3)figures/scale_hist_by_length.jpg: only figure prodcued from scripts. 
4)EmilySchwabe.Rproj: this is meta data about my project from this weeks assignment
5).gitignore:files that do not need to be pushed, not important for this class.
